## Introduction

Some time ago, I read a [blog post](https://colinvermander.com/2020/03/09/power-apps-portals-web-form-ideas-desired-improvements/) from Colin Vermander where he talks about issues and possible improvements that can make usage of Web Form in Power Apps Portal much easier and more convenient. One of them was a proposal to create a way to visualize web form steps as currently, it is pretty complicated to see the whole structure of your web form steps process.

Welcome my PCF Web Form Steps Visualizer! This React based component visualize your web form steps in a flow chart fashion. For now, it only allows you to see some details of each step, but in the future, I plan to add additional functionality.

See it in action below:

{% include video.html webm="webformstepsvisualizer_v0_2_0_0.webm" mp4="webformstepsvisualizer_v0_2_0_0.mp4" %}

It is an early version of the component, so bugs and inconsistency may occur. For the list of known issues, planned updates and releases check out [GitHub repository](https://github.com/OOlashyn/PCF-WebFormStepVisualizer) of the component.
