Recently, on September 5th I was lucky to be a part of first-ever Dynamics 365/Power Apps Saturday dedicated to Power Apps Portal organized by [Arpit Shrivastava](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arpit-shrivastava-29747761). On that event, I talked about upgrading your Power Apps Portal with Progressive Web Apps. You can find all recordings of that event [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLY3Km2RpLuJMEg-73-qRL8T_IqYQHYWD7).

You can find a recording of my session below. The presentation slide-deck and demo code can be found [here](https://github.com/OOlashyn/PowerAppsPortalSaturday2020).
